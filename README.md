# Adam-Numbers
This Project will check for the Adam Number. 
Before coming to the code I would like to tell you WHAT AN ADAM NUMBER IS ??
An ADAM Number is a Number which is equal to its reverse of square root of its squares's reverse ðŸ¤”
You will find above line a bit confusing ðŸ˜…
So let me understand you with an example :
Suppose we have 12 as an integer
than its square will be 144
its reverse will be 441
than square root of 441 will be 21
and finally reverse of 21 will be our original number ie, 12
So, 12 Will Be Said To An ADAM Number. ðŸ¥³
Now Its Your Turn to find out more ADAM Numbers. ðŸ˜Ž
